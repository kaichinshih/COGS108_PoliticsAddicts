    "In this project, we are going to examine the relationship between the trendiness on the Google search engine of several Democratic candidates who are preparing to run in the primary election for the US Presidential Election in 2020 and their fundraising results from the start of the announcements of each of their candidacies to roughly the end of March. For fundraising results of each candidate, we mainly focus on the following three factors: total contributions raised, number of unique donors, and total contribution amount for each United States Census Region and Division. By analyzing the trendiness of candidates on Google as well as fundraising, we endeavor to explore the relationship between the popularity of a candidate on Google and his or her success in fundraising during the same period of time (if a relationship exists at all).\n"

    "The race to become the Democratic Party's frontrunner to take on Trump in 2020 has already begun. More then 25 Democrats have already declared their candidacy for POTUS and have begun campaigning and fundraising. In recent years, campaign funds available to candidates have increasingly determined the way elections pan out. More campaign contributions (and unique donors) indicates greater visibility, more rallies and more opportunties for outreach for candidates, and it can subsquently often be the difference between a win and a loss. In fact, according to the Huffington Post, the number of unique donors a candidate receives will determine who qualifies for the primary debates in 2020, with a requirement of 65,000 unique donors being placed on the qualification. Clearly, this matter is highly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media and online visibility have also played an increasingly important role in a candidate's outreach and momentum. In recent elections, it has completely changed the way candidates interact with their audiences, attract volunteers, and (importantly) gain campaign contributions. Also, with more and more candidates rejecting Super Pac contributions and large donations by corporations, campaign donations by actual voters on a small scale are becoming pivotal to the effectiveness of a candidate's campaign. The volume and distributions of these donations can potentially provide interesting insights into a candidate's viability because it, in a sense, reflects the enthusiasm for the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some contend that the correlation between popularity in social media and political fundraising is virtually non-existent. In \"In the 2020 Race, What is the Value of Political Stardom?,\" Issie Lapowsky addresses the fact that Pete Buttigieg's widespread popularity on social media has not been reflected in the amount of money his campaign has secured. In this project, we attempt to more closely examine the relationship between online visibility and interest in a candidate, and the campaign contributions recieved by them. We hope to explore how a candidate's Google search trends relate to the amount of funds raised by them, the number of unique donors they secure, and the geoographical relationships between their online visibilty and donation rates.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that the total contributions, total number of unique donors, and total contribution amount by each census region will increase as the candidates’ trendiness rises. In other words, we believe that the correlation between donorship and trendiness is positive. But, we are not claiming that there is causation, or that a candidate's trendiness on Google causes an increase in donations, or vice versa. However, we are asserting that there is an association between the two.\n",

    "4.) H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): As a candidate's trendiness increases, the amount of unique donors he or she has increases. \n",
    "5.) H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is no correlation between between a candidate's total contribution amount in a given region and his popularity defined by trendiness in the region. \n",

While Sanders and O'Rourke experience a surge in funding at the beginning of their campaigns, Harris received a surge nearly a month after, one that was likely a byproduct of her political campaigning and townhalls."

    "Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke exhibit clear edges in the New England division. Although this makes sense for Sanders as he is from Vermont, this makes less sense for O'Rourke as he is from Texas. Harris finds greatest contribution from the Pacific division, which makes sense because of her presence as a Senator in California. While Sanders' 2nd most popular division is the Pacific region, Harris' is the New England region. O'Rourke, interestingly, is 2nd most popular in the West South Central region, which contains the state from which he is a representative, Texas.\n",

Our Google trends data is slightly biased in that the popularity rankings given to us per candidate are all relative; the exact number of Google searches per region or per state is not provided to us. Instead, the ranking simply shows us where a candidate experiences hsi highest popularity, and then provides a relative popularity for every other state. For example, since Bernie Sanders has his highest popularity in Vermont, Vermont is given a 100 by Google Trends. The popularity of every other state in terms of search rates is then ranked in comparision, which would indicate that, roughly, for every 100,000 searches a candidate receives in Vermont, he receives 40,000 searches in a state with a ranking of 40. Thus, there is likely a slight skew in how the data is presented. The FEC (Federal Election Commission) data is not subject to this bias because the quantitative values are definitive and accurate.\n",

Our selection of our candidates was rooted in (1) those who show the most promise in the 2020 election, (2) those whose campaign contributions were made readily available by the Federal Election Commission. Thus, we were able to avoid any true ethical concerns in our data collection."

Generally, our hypothesis was proven correct, with a few exceptions in certain instances. The total contribution amount is correlated with a candidate's trendiness overtime in a statistically significant manner for all three candidates. So, for all three candidates, we can reject the null hypothesis that the total contribution amount overtime is not correlated with a candidate's trendiness. A limitation in our analysis is that our adjusted R^2 values are inconsistent across each candidate. So, even though we can confirm that we can reject the null hypothesis, we know that the amount of variation of total contribution amount accounted for by the candidate's popularity varies across candidate, which is expected but simultaneously important to consider.\n",

The fact that we are forced to fai to reject our null hypothesis for a candidate points to a limitation in our analysis.
